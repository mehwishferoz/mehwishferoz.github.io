## Introduction
Welcome to my portfolio, where I showcase my learnings from the Algorithmic Problem Solving (APS) classes. The domain I've chosen to focus on is Computer Networks. Through this portfolio, I aim to demonstrate my understanding of advanced algorithms and their applications in solving real-world problems within the realm of computer networking.

## Why Computer Networks?
The domain of Computer Networks captivates me due to its profound impact on virtually every aspect of modern life. The idea of connecting millions of devices, enabling instant communication, and supporting the vast flow of information is fascinating. Moreover, the continuous evolution of networking technologies presents a constant stream of new challenges and innovations. My curiosity about how these systems work, combined with a desire to improve and innovate within this field, drives my passion for Computer Networks.

## Objective
