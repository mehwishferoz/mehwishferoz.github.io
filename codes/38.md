## Weighted Round Robin (WRR) Algorithm

### Description
The Weighted Round Robin (WRR) algorithm is a network scheduling technique that allocates a proportion of the bandwidth to each flow based on its weight. Each flow is assigned a weight, and the algorithm serves packets from each flow in a cyclic order, but the number of packets served from each flow in one cycle is proportional to its weight.

### C++ Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

struct Flow {
    int id;
    int weight;
    int packets;
};

void WRR(vector<Flow>& flows) {
    int totalWeight = 0;
    for (const auto& flow : flows) {
        totalWeight += flow.weight;
    }

    while (true) {
        bool packetsRemaining = false;
        for (auto& flow : flows) {
            if (flow.packets > 0) {
                packetsRemaining = true;
                int packetsToSend = min(flow.packets, flow.weight);
                flow.packets -= packetsToSend;
                cout << "Flow " << flow.id << " sends " << packetsToSend << " packets." << endl;
            }
        }
        if (!packetsRemaining) break;
    }
}

int main() {
    vector<Flow> flows = {
        {1, 3, 10},
        {2, 1, 5},
        {3, 2, 8}
    };

    WRR(flows);

    return 0;
}
```
### Time and Space Complexity

| Operation                  | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|----------------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Weighted Round Robin (WRR) | O(N * M)        | O(1)             |

Where:
- **N**: Number of flows.
- **M**: Total number of packets to be sent.
